Title: Late Night Ramblings

Original weekly task: charRNN.

Project where you can talk to Tessa, visualised as a WEBGL entity. The voicing is enabled by the p5.js speech library, where she takes your voice input as seed text for a charRNN generated rambling. As you talk, a node connects to Tessa's 'heart' ball, showing the (dis)connections you make. I used the Hemingway model because he was an infamous alcoholic and I enjoyed his content, revolving around themes of death and heroism (having served in WWI) and symbolism of the natural world.

All libraries are included in the project. Once running, you activate Tessa's voice by pressing the 'start' button on the right. You can then talk, wait for her to reply and engage in conversation. It works best talking through headphones so that Tessa does not pick up her own voice, but ramblings ensue as she talks over you sometimes.
